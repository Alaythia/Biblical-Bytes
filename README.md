# Biblical Bytes

An opensource project to create a Bible study tool 
that is easy to use and understand, so that anyone can
study the Bible. 

It has long been a goal of mine to create a bible study 
application. I have used so many different apps in the 
past, and while I appreciated the efforts put into 
creating them, I have found many of them wanting 
concerning the features that I would like to see in 
a study application.

From this desire, Biblical Bytes was born. 

Please join me in creating the best bible study application in the world!
